- Initial meeting with Elena to go over the project details and gather requirements
- Notes:

Kiosk style kinect based continuously running system for presenting a “happy dance” and determining how accurate the users poses are. 

Main goal is to inform visitors about the fact that behaviour influences emotions.
Measuring accuracy is secondary goal.
Top priority is education for the users.

2-8 age range

Vision for happy dance is a sequence of dance moves. Follow along with the dance moves.

1 minuteish long dance

A model will be on screen, not a real person

Music but no voiceover component
Possiblly different songs but the same dance moves

No feedback to the child, just an end screen saying "you're done" with some fireworks or something

Don't need to consider any on screen messages recarding caputing movement info of minors

Assistant will record age of child, if they are a boy/girl, and how happy they are at the start

Assistant will record how happy the child is at the end again

April 14th is the date Elena wants to have something for


Needed from Elena:
Happy scale
Dancer and dance
Happy dance video
